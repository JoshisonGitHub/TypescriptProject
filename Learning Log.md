## Week 1

During the first week of the project I chose a group to work with, as I wanted to work collaboratively with people from the course rather than working collaboratively on a project with people online. I was also in favour of starting a new project rather than working on an existing one and my group shared in that want.

The main task we set ourselves for this week was to think of various project ideas and compile them in a document, linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13toE3SYV0K4IG2FPP6fhk4kCVGq5jh-FQ2uWeFDy4QU/edit).

## Week 2

In the second week of the project development the group and myself got together to discuss the various ideas we came up with an finalise a project to work on. After much discussion we chose to do something with typscript, so we focused on comming up with ideas for projects using typscript. The main project idea we had was a person to person messaging system on a website. We all liked this idea, but continued considering other projects as well. One of us thought of the idea of creating a "mock" banking website, which everyone thought was a great idea. Not only could we make the webiste a single page application, but we could also learn sql for the backend database ontop of learning typscript.

So we decided on what our project would be: **A mock banking website with an sql database linked to the backend**.

We then made a rough timeline of what we will be working on each week:
* Week 3 
  * Learn typscript
* Week 4
  * Get together, make a front end template and back end template
  * Split front end code into sections for each person to complete
  * Split back end code into sections for each person to complete
* Week 5
  * Finish front end and link it to backend
* Week 6
  * Learn SQL for database
* Week 7
  * Create database backend and link it to front end
* Week 8
  * Bug fixes
  * Polish front end
