# Learning Log

## Week 1 
#### Uploaded 16/02/2023

During the first week of the project I chose a group to work with, as I wanted to work collaboratively with people from the course rather than working collaboratively on a project with people online. I was also in favour of starting a new project rather than working on an existing one and my group shared in that want.

The main task we set ourselves for this week was to think of various project ideas and compile them in a document, linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13toE3SYV0K4IG2FPP6fhk4kCVGq5jh-FQ2uWeFDy4QU/edit).

## Week 2
#### Uploaded 16/02/2023

In the second week of the project development the group and myself got together to discuss the various ideas we came up with an finalise a project to work on. After much discussion we chose to do something with typscript, so we focused on comming up with ideas for projects using typscript. The main project idea we had was a person to person messaging system on a website. We all liked this idea, but continued considering other projects as well. One of us thought of the idea of creating a "mock" banking website, which everyone thought was a great idea. Not only could we make the webiste a single page application, but we could also learn sql for the backend database ontop of learning typscript.

So we decided on what our project would be: **A mock banking website with an sql database linked to the backend**.

We then made a rough timeline of what we will be working on each week:
* Week 3 
  * Learn typscript
* Week 4
  * Get together, make a front end template and back end template
  * Split front end code into sections for each person to complete
  * Split back end code into sections for each person to complete
* Week 5
  * Finish front end and link it to backend
* Week 6
  * Learn SQL for database
* Week 7
  * Create database backend and link it to front end
* Week 8
  * Bug fixes
  * Polish front end

### Goals
The next step to achieving our first goal of learning typscript is to use the next week to focus soley on researching typescript.

## Week 3
#### Uploaded 18/02/2023

Firstly in Week 3 we revised the rough timeline made in week 2 to be more logically structured, such as changing working on the back end to after learning SQL. All changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13toE3SYV0K4IG2FPP6fhk4kCVGq5jh-FQ2uWeFDy4QU/edit). 

However, the main focus of this week was learning typescript, which was a very enjoyable experience, as I was able to learn a lot about typescript and all the benefits it has over using vanila javascript.

Whilst I had a lot of issues with javascript, typescript fixes a lot of these problems:
1. **Readability**: The main problem I had with javasctipt was that I found it very difficult to understand other peoples code that I was reading. Typscript fixes this by ading types to each variable which improves legibility, as knowing the type of each variable makes it easier to understand the context of what the input and output types will be / how the function will be used.
2. **Bug Fixes**: As typescript forces all variables to have a type errors caused by wrong typing will be spotted in the interface by typescript, rather than being spotted late in the browser console when using javascript. 

In order to learn typescript I searched for YouTube videos on typescript, but with the assumption that the viewer already knew javascript. This precision searching produced great results with many useful videos demonstrating differences between javascript and typescript, which I will be summerizing in my guide to learners journal. Furthermore, I created a notepad document to summerize what I have learnt and where I got this information from in order to document my learning steps for the time when I create the guide for learners. 

To summarize what I learnt form these videos:
* how to install typescript in vs code using node
* how the packaging system works in node 
* how files are created
* how to apply types to variables
* how to use interfaces in typscript
* how to use functions using interfaces
* how to use classes using interfaces
* why use typescript

### Goals
   
We completed our first goal of learning typscript and next week we will hopefuly have completed our second goal of learning SQL.

## Week 4
#### Uploaded 26/02/2023

This week was a very important week for the project, as we re-revised the timeline to be more realistic of what we would be able to complete during the week (can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13toE3SYV0K4IG2FPP6fhk4kCVGq5jh-FQ2uWeFDy4QU/edit)), as we overestimated how much time we actually had. We also discussed what we wanted to do for the front end development of the website and decided, that we would try using react, as it would allow us to write more typescript. We were also thinking about using sql lite, as it is better for colaborative development, but we will look further into that once the time to apply our sql learnings comes.

We also made the front end template for our website, which is a big part of the front end development process. So next weeks work will be finishing off the front end development.

### Goals

No goals were completed this week, but we are one step closer to finishing the front end of the website.

## Week 5
#### Uploaded 05/03/2023

In the fith week of the project development we started doing the front end development of the website, going of the template created in week 4. I decided to start working on creating the sidebar, as I thought this would take the longest seeing as we were all new to react and typescript. So I started researching and found a couple useful templates for creating a sidebar. However, most of them were created using javascript and react only, not typescript, so I looked through the code in order to understand them to hopefully get a better idea on how the react librarys worked in order to create my own sidebar. Luckily I happen to find a template that used react and typescript, so I studied this template code and tweeked it to hopefully make it work for our project (link to the website can be found [here](https://annysah.hashnode.dev/build-a-sidebar-menu-with-react-typescript-and-styled-components-ckwkykpm80hs7gns112nycvvy)).

Whilst working on the sidebar I attempted to test it to see how it looked on the webpage. However, this did not work due to errors caused by missing libraries, which I was very confused on how to fix, as I followed the tutorial and made sure to install every react library I was using. I even made sure to double check everything. 

On the bright side, whilst I was working on the navbar another one of our members was working on the rest of the page and was able to finish faster than expected, so he decided to give the sidebar a crack as well. He was able to finish the sidebar and push his branch to the main project branch, leaving my attempt obsolite. I am however still very glad that I attempted doing the sidebar as I gained valuable knowledge on how react librarys can be used in conjunciton with typescript to create functional code which is very legable.

### Goals

No goals completed this week, but we are one step closer to achieving Goal 4, to create a functioning website linked with a database, as the website front end is now done.

## Week 6
#### Uploaded 12/03/2023

This week our group learnt sql and made an entity relationship diagram for the database (can be found [here](https://annysah.hashnode.dev/build-a-sidebar-menu-with-react-typescript-and-styled-components-ckwkykpm80hs7gns112nycvvy)), which turned out very well. However, due to other work commitments we have fallen behind our plan on where we should be. We are a week behind and should have already started the back-end development for the website, which we sadly have not. 

I learnt sql through my Database lecturerer this week and learnt about entity relationship diagrams the week before that, which was very useful for learning basic sql commands. I will like the slides used to learn this and the practise paper I completed in my guide to learners.

### Goals

Our second goal has been completed, in that we learnt sql this week.

### To be Completed next Week

Next week we definitely need to make progress on both the database and the backend development of the website. The login system will come next, but if we do not have enough time, it would be better to focus on the database rather than start the login system.

## Week 7 - 9
#### Uploaded 05/04/2023

During the past 3 weeks we have been hard at work making major progress on the Website and have decided that it is now at a point where we are happy to say that it is "finished". The main parts we worked on:

1. New Front End
2. Front End Functionality 
3. Server (Back End)
4. GET and POST Requests 
5. Database

### New Front End

We redid the entire front end so that it wasn't hardcoded in css and instead worked more dinamically with different viewport sizes. Sadly the website doesn't work on phone, but this bug could be fixed if we were to seriously develop this project.

### Front End Functionality 

I was tasked with implementing the front end functionality, such as buttons to create and delete accounts, swtich accounts, and transfer money. To do this I used modals and linked them to the sidebar. I was able to send the data from each input field to the backend for all the functions we implemented (there are a couple extra, unused functions), such as account name, amount of money transfered and so on. I did this using the react version of sending data with json.

### Server

We created a server to host the website which was difficult to implement as the server had to run of a different port and communicate with the wepage rather than having direct access to it. We used paths to link them together.

### GET and POST Requests

We created GET and POST requests for all the data that would be sent to the back end from the website. Such as new_acc to create a new account, del_acc to delete an account and so on. These function are all linked with the database so the input from the front end gets added to the database. We were planning on making the website available to main user via a login system, but were not able to implement it due to time constraints, so the user data in each GET and POST method is a template user.

### Database

The database is fully created and functional and is the most complex part of this entire project as it even contains data that we did not have the time to implement such as a login system with a user ID and user data. This is very useful, as if we were to seriourly develop this project we would not have to change anything in the database, as the entire entity relationship diagram would still be valid.

### Goals

To summarise what Goals we meet and which we fell short on:

* Goal 1: Learn typescript
  * We definitely achieved this goal.
* Goal 2: Learn sql
  * We definitely achieved this goal.
* Goal 3: Create legible code with comments that any coder will understand
  * I would argue that we achieved this goal, as even though we did not add too many comments to our code, we did however segment the code nicely and made variable names and functions that are easy to understand.
* Goal 4: Create a functional Website linked with a database
  * We achieved this goal, as we created a functioning database, linked to a functional front end webpage.
* Goal 5: Create a login system for the website
  * We fell short on this goal due to time constraints, although it would be possible to easily implement it in the future as the database was created with a login system in mind.


### My final thoughts 

I thought that this project worked surprisingly well and we worked well together as a team, helping each other when needed. Without naming them, I am very happy with how our project manager lead the team and continued to stear us down the right path whilst simoultaniously working on their own part of the project. Working with git, although challenging, was very rewarding and I understand better how major project development would work at a company. I gained invaluable knowledge through undergoing this project and even if at times I wished to stop working on the project as typescript was not my favourite to work with, I am glad I persurviered and had the oportunity to learn these new skills.
