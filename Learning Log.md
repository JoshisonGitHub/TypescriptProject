## Week 1 
#### Uploaded 16/02/2023

During the first week of the project I chose a group to work with, as I wanted to work collaboratively with people from the course rather than working collaboratively on a project with people online. I was also in favour of starting a new project rather than working on an existing one and my group shared in that want.

The main task we set ourselves for this week was to think of various project ideas and compile them in a document, linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13toE3SYV0K4IG2FPP6fhk4kCVGq5jh-FQ2uWeFDy4QU/edit).

## Week 2

In the second week of the project development the group and myself got together to discuss the various ideas we came up with an finalise a project to work on. After much discussion we chose to do something with typscript, so we focused on comming up with ideas for projects using typscript. The main project idea we had was a person to person messaging system on a website. We all liked this idea, but continued considering other projects as well. One of us thought of the idea of creating a "mock" banking website, which everyone thought was a great idea. Not only could we make the webiste a single page application, but we could also learn sql for the backend database ontop of learning typscript.

So we decided on what our project would be: **A mock banking website with an sql database linked to the backend**.

We then made a rough timeline of what we will be working on each week:
* Week 3 
  * Learn typscript
* Week 4
  * Get together, make a front end template and back end template
  * Split front end code into sections for each person to complete
  * Split back end code into sections for each person to complete
* Week 5
  * Finish front end and link it to backend
* Week 6
  * Learn SQL for database
* Week 7
  * Create database backend and link it to front end
* Week 8
  * Bug fixes
  * Polish front end

### Goals
The next step to achieving our first goal of learning typscript is to use the next week to focus soley on researching typescript.

## Week 3

Firstly in Week 3 we revised the rough timeline made in week 2 to be more logically structured, such as changing working on the back end to after learning SQL. All changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13toE3SYV0K4IG2FPP6fhk4kCVGq5jh-FQ2uWeFDy4QU/edit). 

However, the main focus of this week was learning typescript, which was a very enjoyable experience, as I was able to learn a lot about typescript and all the benefits it has over using vanila javascript.

Whilst I had a lot of issues with javascript, typescript fixes a lot of these problems:
1. **Readability**: The main problem I had with javasctipt was that I found it very difficult to understand other peoples code that I was reading. Typscript fixes this by ading types to each variable which improves legibility, as knowing the type of each variable makes it easier to understand the context of what the input and output types will be / how the function will be used.
2. **Bug Fixes**: As typescript forces all variables to have a type errors caused by wrong typing will be spotted in the interface by typescript, rather than being spotted late in the browser console when using javascript. 

In order to learn typescript I searched for YouTube videos on typescript, but with the assumption that the viewer already knew javascript. This precision searching produced great results with many useful videos demonstrating differences between javascript and typescript, which I will be summerizing in my guide to learners journal. Furthermore, I created a notepad document to summerize what I have learnt and where I got this information from in order to document my learning steps for the time when I create the guide for learners. 

To summarize what I learnt form these videos:
* how to install typescript in vs code using node
* how the packaging system works in node 
* how files are created
* how to apply types to variables
* how to use interfaces in typscript
* how to use functions using interfaces
* how to use classes using interfaces
* why use typescript

### Goals
   
We completed our first goal of learning typscript and next week we will hopefuly have completed our second goal of learning SQL.
